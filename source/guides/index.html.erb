      <p class="text--grey-4 mb-2">The Work API provides broad access to many of the work tools we all use on a day-to-day basis. In this guide we will walk through the process to get set up on the platform and make our first calls to the API. </p>
      <p class="text--grey-4 mb-2">The guide will initially only cover the process using the Work API Ruby SDK, but will be expanded later to cover other languages as we add support. </p>
