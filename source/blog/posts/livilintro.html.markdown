<strong> What is the issue? </strong>

Every work day, different work applications have to be accessed repeatedly: It is very common for an individual to use multiple email accounts, file sharing solutions, calendars, task management and instant messaging solutions, in addition to more specialised apps. These tools are essentially disconnected information silos, requiring the user to constantly access the different tools independently for information that may be relevant.

For example, let’s say you need to update a marketing flyer: Last year’s flyers are on Dropbox, the new logo has been shared by the Design Agency via Google Drive, colleagues have provided input via Slack and further information is buried in the corresponding task on Trello, whilst contacts have shared their test feedback via email, some of them unfortunately using your old email address.

A straightforward task (such as updating a flyer) is now a complex process involving six or more tools. The advent of worktools for isolated purposes (e.g. Gmail, Dropbox, Trello) as well as the increasing number of account profiles per user has fundamentally disconnected one’s work flows.

As a result, there is a severe lack of transparency of one’s own content with time easily wasted navigating disconnected work tools.

<strong> So, what is the solution? </strong>

livil consolidates and connects the different work tools on one central platform, effectively breaking down the silos of work information. Directors regain transparency and control, and work processes are significantly simplified.

Our company provides a unified interface which syncs with the user’s work applications. Content from those work applications is grouped by media type (e.g. “Documents” or “Emails”) and displayed on tiles in a customizable grid.

The content from different sources can be connected using drag and drop. As an example, a Google Drive file can be attached to an Outlook email in one simple step, or a Box file shared with a Google contact – both processes that are laborious otherwise.

The work content can be filtered and searched centrally in many different ways. If, for example, you are working on the before-mentioned marketing flyer, all corresponding emails, IM posts, documents, calendar events, tasks, etc can be displayed conveniently in one place.

As (digital) work is centralized and connected, substantial contributions are made to increase transparency and save time. Over time, by connecting the individual platforms, an integrated information network is built.
